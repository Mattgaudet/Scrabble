By Ashwitha Ala, Matthew Gaudet, Riya Rawat, Vimal Gunasegaran

## Project Description:
This is a reproduced simplified version of the classic boardgame Scrabble coded in Java. The project is part of a group evaluation for the SYSC 3110 Software Development Project course. The current implementation of the project is text-based however the ultimate goal is create a complete game with good GUI and competent AI opponents.

## How to Play:
As mentioned the current implementation of this project is completely text-based. Every word placed on the board will be printed out within the console.

Valid commands:
> "PLACE (row) (column) (letters with spaces inbetween)" - *places a word* 

> "QUIT" - *exits game*

To use a letter already on the board place parentheses around the letter you enter with the PLACE command. For example, placing BAD down from 1,1 and reusing an 'a' that is already on the board, PLACE 1 1 DOWN B (A) D

## Changelist v0.25:
Changes will be implemented in versions going up by .25, presenting each of the 4 milestones. Here are the changes for v0.25:

- asd
  - asd


## Roadmap:
In the next v0.50 we plan to add a full GUI-based version of the game where users can simply play with their mouse rather then type. The board should be able to update scores and conduct word checks based on what the user has done within the GUI.
